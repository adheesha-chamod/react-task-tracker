# Task Tracker App

To create this app I got help from the [YouTube crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).<br>This contains the react UI as well as the JSON server for the mock backend.
## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

or

```
npm i
```

### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

```
npm run server
```
